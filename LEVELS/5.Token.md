# Description

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic token contract below.

You are given 20 tokens to start with and you will beat the level if you somehow manage to get your hands on any additional tokens. Preferably a very large amount of tokens.

  Things that might help:

- What is an odometer?
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {

  mapping(address => uint) balances;
  uint public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}
```

# Notes

At first I got drifted a little with the challenge description telling me `What is an odometer?` because I thought that was a technical term that is related to the challenge, low and behold, the solution was looking me in the face without the need to look for any "odometer" thingy !

At first glance on the `transfer` function, what directly caught my attention was the way the balance was being reduced from the transaction initiator, it was simply using the `-=` operator on an unsigned integer ! and not even using the safeMath library !

so simply sending 21 tokens to a random address will result in an underflow condition and our balance being `2^256-1`
it's that simple !
