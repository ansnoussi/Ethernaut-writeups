# Description
Look carefully at the contract's code below.

You will beat this level if

1. you claim ownership of the contract
2. you reduce its balance to 0

  Things that might help

- How to send ether when interacting with an ABI
- How to send ether outside of the ABI
- Converting to and from wei/ether units (see `help()` command)
- Fallback methods

    }

  function contribute() public payable {
    require(msg.value < 0.001 ether);
    contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    if(contributions[msg.sender] > contributions[owner]) {
      owner = msg.sender;
    }
  }

  function getContribution() public view returns (uint) {
    return contributions[msg.sender];
  }

  function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  receive() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}

# Notes

From the hints provided and looking at the code of the contract:

- "you claim ownership of the contract" => setting `owner` to the address of our wallet
- "you reduce its balance to 0" => by calling the `withdraw` which in itself requires the previous requirement to be filled.

The task in hand becomes obvious.
We must call the callback function (the one without the `function` keyword which is this case called `receive()`) and satisfy 2 conditions :
1. `msg.value > 0`
2. `contributions[msg.sender] > 0`

#### 1. First condition : contributions[msg.sender] > 0
We must contribute by calling the `contribute` and pass some ether that is less than 0.001 ether but still more than 0 to satisfy the condition in the fallback function.
This can be easily done like so :
```javascript
await contract.contribute({value: toWei('0.0005')})
```
#### 2. Second condition : msg.value > 0
When we call this function we must send some ether when doing so.
this is fairly easy, in fact, when we deployed our smart contract, it got asssigned an address (get it through `contract.address`), so like any other address in the blockchain, we can send it a transaction without calling any function, in case the contract has defined a fallback function, this transaction witll be handled by that fallback function, and in the other case ,where the contract hasn't defined a fallback function, the transaction will be rejected. 

```javascript
contract.sendTransaction({value: toWei('0.0005')})
```


Now all that is left to do is steal the ether :
```javascript
await contract.withdraw()
```
