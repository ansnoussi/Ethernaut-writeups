# Description

Some contracts will simply not take your money `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

  Things that might help:

- Fallback methods
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

# Notes

- To solve this challenge, we must send money to the contract, which in itself is a challenge, because there are no payable functions defined here, so we must look elsewhere.
- The idea is to use the `selfdestruct(address)` low-level opcode call which lets you abandon your smart contract and move all remaining Ethers to another address.
- we can do just that with the attack contract defined bellow :
