# Description
The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you are given.

  Things that might help

- Look into Solidity's documentation on the `delegatecall` low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
- Fallback methods
- Method ids

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Delegate {

  address public owner;

  constructor(address _owner) public {
    owner = _owner;
  }

  function pwn() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}

contract Delegation {

  address public owner;
  Delegate delegate;

  constructor(address _delegateAddress) public {
    delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  fallback() external {
    (bool result,) = address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data);
    if (result) {
      this;
    }
  }
}
```

# Notes

- solving this challenge becomes obvious when knowing on key information about how `delegatecall` works, and that it preserves the calling contractâ€™s context (`storage`,`msg.sender` and `msg.value`)

- So the the idea is to make a transaction to the `Delegation` with the signature of the `pwn()` function, ( function signature is calculated like so : `bytes4(sha3("functionName(inputType)")` ) and since that signature doesn't exist in the `Delegation` contract, the fallback function will be executed and a `delegatecall` will be sent to the `Delegate` contract with the same `msg.value`, and since we are keeping the context here, the `owner` variable changed in the `Delegate` contract is in fact changing in  `Delegation`. ( Note : it is mandatory that the `owner` variable in bother contracts has the same slot in both contracts, aka first slot. )
- So the final payload is the flollowing : 
```
await sendTransaction({
  from: player,
  to: contract.address,
  data: "0xdd365b8b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
});
```
